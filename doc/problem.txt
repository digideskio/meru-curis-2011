Assertion: complex movement is what makes virtual worlds interactive and interesting.

Currently, the difficulty of coordinating motion in Sirikata grows quickly with increasing complexity, requiring:

* constant monitoring of the state of the world
* frequent updates to position and velocity
* attention to numerical stability in feedback-loop approaches

The space physics system is an exception, but it is not yet flexible enough to meet the needs of all applications.
