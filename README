meru-curis
William Monroe (futurulus)

This repository contains all of my working files for Meru: Building a Virtual
City, part of the 2011 CURIS summer research program at Stanford University.
It consists mainly of four types of files:

* Source
Scripts to run in the Sirikata virtual world platform, the subject of the
summer's research.  Scripts are mostly in Emerson (*.em), a superset of
JavaScript than can be read by the Sirikata client (object host).  The
occasional source file describing a user interface is written in pure
JavaScript (*.js).

* Meshes
Final meshes for Sirikata are in the COLLADA interchange format (*.dae); working
project files are in various other 3D model formats, most commonly Google
SketchUp (*.skp) and Blender (*.blend).

* Images and other media
Includes screenshots, screencasts, and images used to texture models.

* Text documentation and notes
My own notes, copies of tutorials I've written for the wiki (in MediaWiki markup
-- see http://sirikata.com/wiki/User:Wmonroe4), the first draft and final draft
of my research poster, and other information in textual form.

The files in this repository are very much drafts; they are not guaranteed to be
correct, and even those which are correct now (25 Aug 2011) will almost
certainly become outdated very quickly.

While I hope the Emerson scripts in particular will be useful as examples, the
usual disclaimer applies: the files in this repository come with NO WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, to the extent permitted by law.  See the file COPYING for details
about licensing.
